The system evaluates trend strength, volatility, structure, and risk parameters to determine whether a trade setup is valid or should be avoided.

Key Features:
• Trend detection using EMA structure, RSI, and Supertrend
• ATR-based entry, stop-loss, and targets
• Position sizing using fixed-risk methodology
• Scoring engine that outputs VALID or AVOID
• Complete breakdown of risk amount, position size, and market context

The model focuses on risk-first trading, ensuring losses remain controlled even in volatile markets.
